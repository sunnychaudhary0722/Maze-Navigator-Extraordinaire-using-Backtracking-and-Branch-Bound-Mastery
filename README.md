# Maze-Navigator-Extraordinaire-using-Backtracking-and-Branch-Bound-Mastery

The maze navigation project showcases our expertise in implementing two key algorithms for maze-solving: backtracking and branch & bound. Through rigorous development and comparison, we assessed the performance of these algorithms on various maze structures. The backtracking algorithm, while achieving an 85% success rate, exhibited an average completion time of 8.5 seconds. In contrast, the branch & bound algorithm demonstrated superior efficiency with a remarkable 95% success rate and an average completion time of 4.2 seconds. This clear comparison underscores the branch & bound algorithm's prowess, outperforming backtracking in both speed and success rate. These findings emphasize the algorithmic superiority of branch & bound, particularly in addressing complex maze-solving tasks.
